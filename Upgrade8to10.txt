1. https://jasontaylor.dev/asp-net-core-angular-9-upgrade/

To upgrade from 8 to 10 I followed the guide above to upgrade to angular 9, then did the following to upgrade to 10.
1. I don't need angular universal so I removed "ModuleMapLoaderModule" and it's import from "ClientApp\src\app\app.server.module.ts".
2. I removed "@nguniversal/module-map-ngfactory-loader" from package.json
3. Ran "npm install"
4. Installed latest angular cli using "npm i -g @angular/cli"
5. Ran "ng update @angular/core @angular/cli"
6. Ran "dotnet run" without any issues.
